## Design decision :bulb:

Sometimes there is more than one way to do something. Here are some
reason why we did certain things in a certain manner.

## Write what you decide :pencil2:

In lesson development, many decisions are made within group discussions, sprints or conferences. In order to be able to track these, it is useful to store a meeting_notes.md in the repo.
This md file documents all discussions that have been held and all decisions that have been made, to make the development easier to understand for newcomers. To make such a meeting_notes.md file was also one decision at a certain time and now is also tracked! :+1:

## Keep lessons as simple as possible

## Pacing and overall schedule

* Pacing: The modularity of the lesson allows instructors to select the amount of content
appropriate to the needs of the learners. 
* Each module has 15 minutes of stretch content which may be optionally included.
* There is an additional 30 minutes built into the startup time to accomodate delays.
